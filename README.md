For the csv file of macrophage data contact Dr Julia Sero as the file size is too large to be uploaded.

Groupings_Explained.py
This script contains information on how the data has been grouped for analysis.

kmeans_parameters.py
This script selects Kmeans parameters using GridSearch algorithm

UMAP_Parameters.py
This script selects UMAP parameters using GridSearch algorithm

Model_testing.py
This script contains the failed model creating pipeline.

UMAP_graph_features_compared.py
